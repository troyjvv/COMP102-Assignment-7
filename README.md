## My COMP102 Java Assignment 7 Code
The assignment was to make a game where a player shoots from the bottom of the screen in a designated area to make it more challenging. The player aims at balls that have multiple levels of damage. When a ball is fully damaged it explodes and spreads damage to other balls in its proximity, spreading almost like a virus. 

## What the code has:
- GUI usage
- Score keepign
- Gun with indicator on where user can aim
- Ammo indicator
- Ball class with:
    - Health, visual indicator of health level
    - Exploding and spreading damage to other balls in the proximity
