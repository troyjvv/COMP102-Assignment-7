/**
 * DiskGame is a simple game where the player must blow up disks spread across
 * a shooting range.
 * The game starts with a collection of randomly placed small disks in the upper
 * half of the graphics pane, and a gun at the bottom.
 * The gun is fixed in the center of a horizontal line below the shooting range
 * and can shoot in any direction within a 180-degree radius.
 * The player fires the gun using the mouse, by releasing it within the firing
 * zone, which is limited by an arc surrounding the upper part of the gun. This
 * determines the direction of the shot.
 * If a shot hits a disk, it will damage it.
 * If the disk is damaged enough, it will explode and may damage nearby disks,
 * if they are within range.
 * The player has a limited number of shots, and the goal is to cause as much
 * damage as possible.
 * Each disk has a score based on the amount of damage it sustainedâ€”the greater
 * the damage, the higher the score. The game's total score is the sum of the
 * scores for all the disks.
 * The game ends when the player runs out of shots or when all the disks have
 * exploded.
